Course Management - SOAP Web Service with Spring Boot

Creating SOAP Web Service using Contract First Approach:

- > Define the service: XML, XSD(XML Schema Definition),
    WSDL (Format of Request and Response: Envelope/Header/Body)

- > Java API for XML Binding (JAXB): 
    Take the XSD and convert the request to an Object and convert the Object to Response

- > Framework Configuration (Endpoint: process request and create response and populate the response to JAXB, 
    WSDL-Generation: configurate Spring Framework to generate)

- > SOAP Web Service Client (Wizdler Chrome Plugin): Send Request and get Results
